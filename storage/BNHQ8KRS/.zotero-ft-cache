We present Supermarket-6DoF, a real-world dataset of 1500 grasp attempts across 20 supermarket objects with publicly available 3D models. Unlike most existing grasping datasets that rely on analytical metrics or simulation for grasp labeling, our dataset provides ground-truth outcomes from physical robot executions. Among the few real-world grasping datasets, wile more modest in size, Supermarket-6DoF uniquely features full 6-DoF grasp poses annotated with both initial grasp success and post-grasp stability under external perturbation. We demonstrate the dataset's utility by analyzing three grasp pose representations for grasp success prediction from point clouds. Our results show that representing the gripper geometry explicitly as a point cloud achieves higher prediction accuracy compared to conventional quaternion-based grasp pose encoding.
